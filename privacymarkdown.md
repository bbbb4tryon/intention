# Privacy Policy

## What We Collect
- **On-device data**    : your categories and tiles are stored locally on your device (UserDefaults or similar).
- **Purchase status**   : subscription state handled by Apple; we store only what’s needed to unlock features.
- **No login, no email**: the App does not require an account; if/when we move to a website, we may require use of an Authenticator app for a One-Time-Password to verify purchases.

## Analytics 
We collect metrics to improve the App. Your device and data are anonymous.  We really don't want to know what you are doing, but we DO want to improve the App. 

Contact us to improve the app (Use the *Feedback* button in Settings). If a critical mass wants a change, we will take time to properly develop and implement; if minor mass requests a change, we may implement it in the future. Rude requests will receive neither a reply, nor action. We would judge tone and content by common sense evaluation.

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your data. As *Apple* requires it to process purchases, we would share your information with them.

## Your Choices
You can delete your local data in Settings.

## Security
We use reasonable safeguards, but no method is 100% secure.

## Changes & Contact
We may update this policy. Contact: privacy@yourdomain.com. We're a small group, big on dogs and friends and family; please have grace and be nice. We can't meet all demands and requests, but we WILL try.''
