# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-08-19_

## What We Collect
- **On-device data**: your categories and tiles are stored locally on your device (UserDefaults or similar).
- **Purchase status**: subscription state handled by Apple; we store only whatâ€™s needed to unlock features.
- **No login, no email**: the App does not require an account; we may use a device phone number for processing.

## Analytics (Optional)
If enabled in Settings, we may collect anonymous usage metrics to improve the App. We really don't want to know what you are doing, but we DO want to improve the App. Contact us to improve the app - if a critical mass wants a change, we will take time to properly develop and implement; if minor mass requests a change, we may implement it in the future. Be nice with all request.'

## Data Sharing
We do not sell your data. We may share strictly necessary info with Apple to process purchases.

## Your Choices
You can delete your local data in Settings.

## Security
We use reasonable safeguards, but no method is 100% secure.

## Changes & Contact
We may update this policy. Contact: privacy@yourdomain.com. We're a small group, big on dogs and friends and family; please have grace and be nice. We can't meet all demands and requests, but we WILL try.''
